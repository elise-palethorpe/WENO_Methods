# WENO Methods

Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating the implementation of Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory methods for modelling partial differential equations. Comparison with finite difference schemes is made.

The contents of this repository were prepared as part of an undergraduate research course at ANU; semester 2, 2020.
